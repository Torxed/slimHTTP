# slimHTTP
A simple, minimal and flexible HTTP server.<br>
Supports modules for parsing WebSocket traffic as well as REST api routes.

## Supports

 * REST routes *(`@http.route('/some/endpoint')`)*
 * websocket if a `@http.on_upgrade` function is defined
 * Static file emulation with `@http.route('/example.html')`
 * vhosts
 * ssl/tls
 * flexible configuration for webroots etc via `@http.configuration`

## Minimal example

```py
import slimhttpd

http = slimhttpd.host(slimhttpd.HTTP)

while 1:
	for event, *event_data in http.poll():
		pass
```

The only important thing is that `.poll()` has to be called in order to process the events.

## Footnote

It's not pretty down here. But it'll do in a pinch.
