# slimHTTP
A simple, minimal and flexible HTTP server.<br>
Responds to GET or whatever protocol handlers you define as parameters to `http_serve`.<br>
Manipulate headers, overall protocol data, payloads and session states.. Sky is the limit.

## Supports

 * vhosts
 * keep-alive
 * ssl/tls
 * websocket if a upgrade() module is supplied
 * flexible configuration for webroots etc.

## Footnote

It's not pretty down here. But it'll do in a pinch.
