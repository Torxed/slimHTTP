Installation
============

.. note:: These instructions apply to slimHTTP |version|.

slimHTTP is a pure python library, so no special steps are required for
installation. You can install it in a variety of ways, or simply copy the
`slimHTTP` folder directly into your project.

You can clone the repository using **git**:

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/Torxed/slimHTTP.git


To enable WebSockets, you'll need to firstly handle `Connection: Upgrade` request headers and then supply a appropriate upgrade module. More on this in `Enabling WebSockets <programming_guide/enabling_websockets>`_.
