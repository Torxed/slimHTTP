slimHTTP Documentation
======================

| **slimHTTP** is a simple, minimal and flexible HTTP server.
| It supports REST api routes, WebSocket [1]_ traffic and native Python imports as vhost endpoints.
| 
| Here's a `demo <https://scientist.cloud/>`_ using minimal setup: 

.. code-block:: py

    import slimHTTP
    
    http = slimHTTP.server(slimHTTP.HTTP)
    http.run()

Some of the features of slimHTTP are:

* **No external dependencies or installation requirements.** Runs without any external requirements or installation processes.

* **Single threaded.** slimHTTP takes advantage of `select.epoll()` *(select.select() on Windows)* to achieve blazing speeds without threading the service. Threads are allowed and welcome, but the core code relies on using as few threads and overhead as possible.

.. [1] WebSocket support is provided by using a `@app.on_upgrade` hook and parsed by a separate library, like spiderWeb_
